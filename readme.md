*Tip: Install the conda tool beforehand*
1. Creating a Virtual Environment:
```bash
conda create --name env_tinygc --file spec-list.txt

2. Activating the Virtual Environment:
```bash
conda activate env_tinygc

3. It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code to open ipynb files, which requires installing the Jupyter extension beforehand.

### Testing with Pre-trained Models
Directly run the eval_proc_euroc.ipynb file located in the code directory to obtain the output results.

### Retraining the Model
Directly run the train_proc_euroc.ipynb file located in the code directory to start training.
